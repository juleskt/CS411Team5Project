What Could Go Wrong?

One of the ingredients does not exist on the Amazon website. In this case we will display a message saying it does not exist on the website. In this case the user either choose to buy the rest of the ingredients or choose another recipe.

There are no saved recipes in the user database, in which case the app will display a message stating that the user does not have any saved recipes. In this case the user will have to search for recipes.

The user is not satsified with the top five choices provided by Amazon in which case the user can either omit that ingredient or pull up the next five options provided by Amazon.

The user accidentally adds an item to the cart. In this case they can remove that item when they check out in the final step.
